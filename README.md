# Description:

This repository contains scripts for the construction of multiple sequence alignment from protein sequences using MUSCLE (MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation).

## Two Functions:

1. **ncbiFastaFilesDownloaderFunc:** will download the fasta sequence data from NCBI' Protein database using sequence accessions. 
2. **fileMergerFunc:** will merge fasta files into a single file to use as input for Muscle.
